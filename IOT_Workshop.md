## IOT Workshop 

### Report
A workshop on the domain of Internet of Things (IOT) was conducted by the members of the Open Source Lab of Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering. The workshop was held at Tinkering Labs situated in MICA PU college on the 10th of October 2019.

### Objective
The purpose of the workshop was to educate the young nurturing minds about the vast and booming world of Internet of Things and how it has contributed towards further developments in the world of technology.

### Experience
The students at MICA PU college were first given a brief introduction about fundamentals of IOT and how multiple elements contribute to it. The hands on workshop enabled the students to learn about various sensors and open Source platforms like Arduino, ESP8266 and NodeMcu which can be used to build and experiment with a number of basic projects.The students were also asked to actively participate in project showcases and discussions.Some of the projects include :

#### Bar graph

This project focused on how a real bar graph works . With the help of a simple arduino board, a few LED’s, a potentiometer and jumper wires we were able to integrate systems to make the LED’s glow when the potentiometer value is increased. This made all the LEDs placed in a line glow and gives the effect of a bar graph.

  

#### Light Dependent Resistor
Through this system we were able to make the value read from an Analog pin actually increase as  the intensity of light also increased. For this we uses a tiny circuit that pushed power through the LDR and since the LDR decreases its resistance as light increases, more “power” should pass through it through the Analog pin, which results in the Arduino “reading” a higher value.The analog pin will read values between 0 and 1023, so it converts the analog signal to a digital representation - also called Analog Digital Converter (AD or ADC), which is build into the Arduino board.In simple words, as the intensity of light increases so does the value of resistance.
