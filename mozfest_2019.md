### Introduction
MozFest is a gathering of educators, activists, technologists, researchers, artists, and young people dedicated to creating a better, healthier internet. People around the world are invited to present on the same after a vigorous filtration process of proposals from all around the world. The facilitators for our session were Sanjith PK, Umesh A and Shashank Atherya.

### Event
There was a worldwide call for proposals under various domains such as Web Literacy, Openness, Digital Inclusion, Privacy and Security, Decentralization etc. in the month of July. We submitted multiple proposals under various domains. Our proposal under privacy and security was invited to present a session at Ravensbourne University, Greenwich, London.

Our proposal “**Entropy**” is a project which aims to create stronger and secure passwords alongside overcoming the flaws of a traditional alphanumeric password generator. This could be done using the aid of Diceware. We presented our session to a very diverse group of people from various backgrounds and ethnicity. This helped us gain many perspectives and valuable feedback on our project on how to improve it and make it into a product for the real world.
