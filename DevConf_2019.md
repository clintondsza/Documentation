We talked about Common Voice, Localization, A-Frame.

**On day 1 of DevConf (2nd August 2019),**  we started with our booth setup which was taken care of by few of our Mozillians and the booth was setup and ready by 9am.

It looked something like this after the setup.

We explained about Common Voice and Localization on first day and got most of the attendees to start contributing to Common Voice right there on the booth.  
People enjoyed contributing to Common Voice and were interested to explore more about it, how it works and how they can access the data of common voice.

The crowd kept on increasing on the booth, I had plans of attending a couple of talks but the crowd on the booth was so huge that I ended up spending most of the time on the booth talking to people about the products and initiatives of Mozilla and how they can get involved in Mozilla community.

By the end of the day 1 we did around 92% of daily goal for Common Voice contributions

Both the days were very interesting, we enjoyed a lot. We talked to people from different backgrounds which included students and professionals.  
Since, this was our first time as a volunteer at booth, we were really amazed seeing the huge crowd who were interested to contribute to the community and were eager to know more on how to get more involved with the community.  
We think this was our best developer event till now. We met a lot of Mozillians and Members from Red Hat and other open source community.

Thanks to all volunteers, organizers, sponsors, speakers, etc for this awesome DevConf. I hope to see you all again in next DevConf.
